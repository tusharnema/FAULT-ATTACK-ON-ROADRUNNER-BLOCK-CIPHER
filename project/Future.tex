We have derived an algorithm to find the key by doing Fault attack on RoadRunneR and thus we are on the way of implementing a program which can find out the key of the block cipher when it receive a cipher text.

Additionally we have also initialized writing our first research paper providing a relevant and substantial thesis of the Fault attack we did on the block cipher.
