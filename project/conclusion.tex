A very efficient Feistel type bitslice block cipher, RoadRunneR, with 64-bit block size and 80-bit or 128-bit key length was presented. RoadRunneR is a perfect choice for devices with very restricted memory resources and for applications requiring reasonable throughput expectations. Our cipher has a high security margin in contrast to most of other lightweight block ciphers.\\

We did a fault attack on the block cipher and found the related equations. Then we derived an algorithm to find the solutions to those equations. We have proposed all the possibiliy of the pair of keys which could have been found.
